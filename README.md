The dataset consists of information pertaining to the following parameters:
* Orders
* Products
* Departments
* Customers

# Tools

The following python libraries were used for this project:
* pandas - for data analysis
* matplotlib - for visualizations
* seaborn - for visualizations

# Code Execution

The code is available via Jupyter notebooks, under /03_Scripts/. 

# Analysis and Visualizations

Visualizations were generated in Jupyter notebooks and can be found in /04_Analysis/Visualizations/. 

A final report was generated summarizing the steps taken in the analysis and the results and recommendations from the analysis.
